This is list of criteria which are important for Chorus One:

- [ ] results of enabling inflation on private testnet
- [ ] fully working delegation on 2fac-enabled accounts
- [ ] number of nodes is above `ideal_connections_lo`
- [ ] NEAR web wallet with delegation capabilities
- [ ] approximately 105M $NEAR delegated to active validators

Ordered from most to least important. We hope, all above are
met before 9 October 2020. Last bullet point may be difficult
to achieve and it's out of control of Chorus One or NEAR team,
so we may vote before 105M $NEAR is delegated.
